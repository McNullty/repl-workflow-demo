# repl-workflow-demo

This library will demonstrate working with REPL using reloaded workflow.

I will follow documentation in this library: https://github.com/tolitius/mount
Mount library is alternative to Stuarts Sierra Component library, but it is used
by Luminus framework, is still deleoped and markets itself as more flexible.

Documentation will be done using [lein-marginalia "0.9.0"] You can look for documentation here: https://gdeer81.github.io/marginalia/
